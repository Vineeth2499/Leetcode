There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It may contain duplicates.
This table contains the date and the name of the product sold and the IDs of the lead and partner it was sold to.
The name consists of only lowercase English letters.

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
For 2020-12-8, toyota gets leads = [0, 1] and partners = [0, 1, 2] while honda gets leads = [1, 2] and partners = [1, 2].
For 2020-12-7, toyota gets leads = [0] and partners = [1, 2] while honda gets leads = [0, 1, 2] and partners = [1, 2].

## 🧠 Approach

The requirement is to compute, **for each date and product**, the number of **distinct leads** and **distinct partners**.

1. **Group data at the required level**  
   Grouped the records by:
Since the counts are needed per day and per product.

2. **Count distinct leads**  
Used:
To calculate the number of unique leads for each `(date_id, make_name)` combination.

3. **Count distinct partners**  
Used:
To calculate the number of unique partners for the same group.

4. **Final output**  
Returned:
- `date_id`
- `make_name`
- number of distinct leads (`unique_leads`)
- number of distinct partners (`unique_partners`)

### 📌 Key Insight
When a table may contain duplicate rows and unique counts are required, combining **GROUP BY** with **COUNT(DISTINCT …)** is the most direct and reliable approach.
