# Leetcode

This repository tracks my daily LeetCode practice as part of my data analytics journey.
Focus areas include SQL, Python, and PySpark to stay consistent with core concepts and problem-solving skills.

## Goals
- Solve at least 1 problem daily (scaling to 2–3 in the future)
- Strengthen SQL fundamentals for analytics interviews
- Practice Python for data manipulation and logic
- Learn PySpark for large-scale data processing

## Status
🚧 Actively maintained  
📅 Daily practice ongoing
